## What Are SVGs?

- **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG):**
  - XML-based markup language for describing 2D vector graphics.
  - Uses shapes such as lines, curves, circles, and polygons.
  - Resolution-independent, making them perfect for scalable and high-quality graphics.

## Why Use SVGs?

- **Scalability:**  
  - Can be resized to any dimensions without losing quality.
- **Small File Sizes:**  
  - Typically more efficient for icons and simple illustrations compared to raster images.
- **Interactivity & Animation:**  
  - Easily styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript.
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Text remains selectable and searchable.
- **Editability:**  
  - As an XML format, it is straightforward to edit and optimize.

## Difference Between Raster Images and SVGs

- **Raster Images:**
  - Composed of individual pixels.
  - Common formats include JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
  - Quality degrades (pixelation) when scaled beyond its original dimensions.
  - Best for detailed photographs and complex imagery.
  
- **SVGs:**
  - Composed of vectors defined by mathematical formulas.
  - Infinitely scalable without quality loss.
  - Ideal for icons, logos, and simple illustrations.
  - Can be dynamically styled and animated.

## Basics of SVGs

- **Inline SVG:**
  - Embedding SVG code directly into your HTML file.
  - **Examples Include:**
    - **Circle:** `<circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" fill="blue" />`
    - **Rectangle:** `<rect width="100" height="50" fill="green" />`
    - **Polygon:** `<polygon points="100,0 200,0 200,100 100,100" fill="red" />`
    - **Line:** `<line x1="0" y1="0" x2="200" y2="200" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" />`
    - **Other Shapes:** Ellipse, Polyline, Path, and Text.
  
- **SVG Using `<symbol>` and `<use>`:**
  - Define reusable graphic elements using `<symbol>`.
  - Render the symbol with `<use>` to avoid repeating the same code.
  
- **SVG Via `<img>` Tag:**
  - Embed an external SVG file.
  - Keeps the SVG code separate from your HTML, which aids in organization and caching.
  - **Example:** `<img src="external.svg" alt="External SVG Example" width="200" height="200" />`

## Code Explanation

- **Inline SVG Examples:**
  - **Circle:**  
    - Creates a blue circle with center coordinates `(100, 100)` and a radius of `50`.
  - **Rectangle:**  
    - Renders a green rectangle with a width of `100` and a height of `50`.
  - **Polygon:**  
    - Draws a red quadrilateral by connecting specified points.
  - **Line:**  
    - Draws a black diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right.
  - **Additional Elements:**  
    - **Ellipse:** Creates an oval shape.
    - **Polyline:** Connects multiple points with straight lines.
    - **Path:** Uses commands (like quadratic BÃ©zier curves) for complex curves.
    - **Text:** Displays text within the SVG.

- **SVG Using `<symbol>` and `<use>`:**
  - **Symbol Definition:**  
    - The `<symbol>` element defines a star shape (or any graphic) which is hidden (`style="display: none;"`) from direct display.
  - **Symbol Usage:**  
    - The `<use>` element references this symbol with `href="#starSymbol"` to display it.

- **SVG Via `<img>` Tag:**
  - **Embedding External SVG:**  
    - Uses an `<img>` tag to load the external file `external.svg`.
    - Ensures that the external file is in your project directory.

- **External SVG File (`external.svg`):**
  - **XML Declaration:**  
    - Specifies XML version and encoding.
  - **SVG Container:**  
    - Sets the width, height, and SVG namespace.
  - **Graphic Elements in External SVG:**  
    - **Background Rectangle:** Provides a light grey background.
    - **Circle:** Draws a sky blue circle.
    - **Triangle (Polygon):** Creates a lime green triangle.
    - **Diagonal Line:** Draws a black diagonal line.
    - **Text:** Displays a label at the bottom indicating "External SVG".
